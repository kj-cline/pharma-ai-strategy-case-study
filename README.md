# AI Strategy for Pharmacovigilance and Supply Chain Optimization (Pharmaceutical Case Study)

## Overview

This project presents a strategic roadmap for implementing artificial intelligence to improve pharmacovigilance signal detection, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency in a global pharmaceutical organization. The analysis was conducted as part of a graduate consulting engagement focused on healthcare analytics, regulated systems, and AI-enabled operational transformation.

The project evaluates how AI can enhance safety monitoring, reduce operational costs, accelerate drug development timelines, and improve decision-making across clinical and supply chain workflows.

This repository contains only academic and publicly shareable strategic analysis. All proprietary and confidential information has been excluded.

## Business Problem

Pharmaceutical organizations face increasing challenges in managing large volumes of safety, clinical, and operational data while maintaining strict regulatory compliance. Key constraints include:

• Manual signal detection and risk assessment workflows  
• Long processing timelines for safety and regulatory reporting  
• High operational costs driven by labor-intensive processes  
• Increasing data volume across clinical trials and pharmacovigilance systems  

These challenges create opportunities for AI-enabled automation, predictive analytics, and scalable data processing.

## Strategic Objectives

The project focused on identifying opportunities to:

• Improve pharmacovigilance signal detection efficiency  
• Reduce operational costs through AI-enabled automation  
• Accelerate safety analysis and regulatory reporting timelines  
• Maintain compliance with global regulatory frameworks (FDA, EMA, GDPR, HIPAA)  
• Balance internal AI capabilities with external AI platforms

## Approach

The analysis included:

• Evaluation of internal vs. external AI implementation strategies  
• Assessment of regulatory, operational, and technical constraints  
• Identification of high-impact AI use cases in pharmacovigilance workflows  
• Strategic vendor and platform evaluation  
• Cost-benefit and operational impact analysis  
• Development of an implementation roadmap
